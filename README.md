# HealthHelpersWebApp
Responsive web app created using Javascript

This is a responsive web app created using Javascript, HTML & CSS. The app was created to help individuals determine whether 
or not they may be eligible for travel assistance.Currently on the Ministry of Health website if you wanted to check if you 
were eligible you would have to go through a checklist and determine yourself if you are eligible.

The app breaks this checklist down into easy steps that the user can easily understand and complete, then at the end they 
can check whether or not they are eligible. Initially when I was given the project I was told I had one week to come up with 
a fully working demo to present, this really tested my ability of being able to deliver a working solution quickly and to 
a professional standard that the client would be happy with. Overall I really learned a lot from working on this project 
and was glad to have had the opportunity.
